<h1>Hi :sunny: </h1>

<h3>
We are students :alien: of the GoIT IT Academy, where we delve into knowledge for 12 months, starting from learning HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and Sass, progressing to JS libraries, the React framework, Next.js, npm, and webpack.</h3>

In our first group project, we were supposed to create a website for a company that sells natural ice cream. We received a ready-made project template prepared in Figma. In our 10-person team, we built a responsive website from scratch.
